# JS_CUSTOM_VID_PLAYER_APP
The HTML5 video player - is a custom interface where I the  
hide the default controls and built my own interface with a 
button to pause and play it there's going to be a button that 
this does the volume a slider this is going to Speed it right 
up so it goes much faster it's going to bring it right down to 
be nice and slow, also adding skip buttons that allow you to 
skip forward 25 seconds to get back 10 seconds and finally 
when you click the video itself it will pause.
